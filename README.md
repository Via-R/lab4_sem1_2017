# Convex hull building
This labwork implements the process of building the convex hull on a set of predefined points
## How to test
In order to test the labwork, you need MS Visual Studio C++ installed, then clone the repository using

    > git clone https://github.com/Via-R/lab4_sem1_2017.git

Then open the .sln file with MS Visual Studio and launch the project. You also need to choose `Win32` or 	`x86` platform to successfully build the project.
Once you launch the compiled project, you will see the convex hull that was built on the points defined in `input.txt` file. If you want to build your own convex hull, just edit the `input.txt` file with your set of points (they should be in [-50, 50] x [-50, 50] space).
